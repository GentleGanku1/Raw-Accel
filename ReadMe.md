# Raw Accel

Raw Accel is a Windows 10 & Windows 11 x86-64 driver which allows for the acceleration of mouse input in the raw input stream. It started as a replacement for [InterAccel](https://github.com/KovaaK/InterAccel) and has been extended with more acceleration types, charts, and other features.

## Anti-Cheat Friendly

[Releases](https://github.com/a1xd/rawaccel/releases/latest) of the Raw Accel driver are signed and run in system space. Raw Accel only modifies mouse input by a constant set of formulas, and adds a one-second delay when changing settings in order to mitigate its abuse.

## Getting Help

For an overview of everything Raw Accel has to offer, please see the [guide](doc/Guide.md). For questions, see the [FAQ](doc/FAQ.md) first.

## Development

Development of Raw Accel is ongoing. See "User Interface 2.0" below for work on next release. Bug reports and pull requests are always welcome.  Join [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/7pQh8zH) if you want to stay updated with releases or say hello.

### User Interface 2.0
The next release of Raw Accel is planned to have a new User Interface. Work for this is ongoing at https://github.com/RawAccelOfficial/rawaccel/tree/userinterface. Check out the ReadMe in that branch if interested in contributing.

## External Websites
Raw Accel has moved from its old home at https://github.com/a1xd/rawaccel to https://github.com/RawAccelOfficial/rawaccel. (If you are unsure, you can check that the original link redirects to the new one.)  
The latest version of Raw Accel is always hosted [here on github](https://github.com/RawAccelOfficial/rawaccel). There is no other site or mirror where you can be sure get official versions of Raw Accel.   
Raw Accel is not affiliated with any external websites, such as rawaccel.net or rawaccel.com. If Raw Accel ever were to be affiliated with an external site, it would be mentioned here on github first.
