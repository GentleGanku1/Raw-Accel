# Raw Accel

Raw Accel is a Windows 10 & Windows 11 x86-64 driver which allows for the acceleration of mouse input in the raw input stream. 

## Anti-Cheat Friendly

[Releases](https://github.com/GentleGanku1/Raw-Accel/releases/tag/v1.6.1) of the Raw Accel driver are signed and run in system space. Raw Accel only modifies mouse input by a constant set of formulas, and adds a one-second delay when changing settings in order to mitigate its abuse.
